Using various algorithms to find the best features that best describe the class_label attribute

Algorithms used:
1)Logistic Regression with SGD Optimization using ElasticNet
2) l2 Regularized Logistic Regression (log loss) using Stochatic Gradient Descent
3)vanilla decision tree

The repo has 2 notebooks one is the ideal one and the other is under developemnet
